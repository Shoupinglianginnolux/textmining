The only thing that happened was an automatic update from Vizio. \\n \\nI also took it off the soundbar, and still did not get audio from the built-in speakers. I think I\'ve ruled out the sound bar as the problem.\\n\\nI can fix it by unplugging the TV and waiting a couple minutes, then plug back in. The sound takes 10-20 seconds to start working again. I had to do this twice today. This TV is wall mounted, I\'m short, and the plug is behind the TV. \\n\\nPrior to this issue, I had needed to reboot the TV more often than I think is reasonable, but not too bad.
